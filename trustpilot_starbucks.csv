"1677243219-240","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","In the past the medium house blend was one of my favourites, this time I bought some at morrisons to make at home. Big mistake,  upon opening the bag I was greater with a fishy almost curry like smell. Thinking it was probably just packaging gas I proceeded to brew the coffee.  It tastes nothing like at the store, infact it tastes worse than lidl coffee.

I won't be buying this again, I do buy Costa signature medium, this actually tastes better than in their store."
"1677243219-241","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","I went to starbucks at 8.30pm they didnt accept cash so my friend an do went to her dad and when we got there it was closed at 8.59pm but it closes at 9pm they could’ve made the drink 😡😡😡😡😡"
"1677243219-242","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","The wait for 1 large Latte was ridiculous. It wasn’t that busy, but the staff didn’t work as a team, they were all over the place, one minute on the till, the next putting stickers on stock on the shop floor, the next time they’re making drinks. It was a complete mess. And when I asked how long my coffee would be (after waiting 15 minutes) I was told they didn’t know, and they are doing other things and didn’t have time for my conversation. They were snappy, rude and unhelpful. In the end I had to walk away with no coffee otherwise I would miss the train I was getting, I would of thought giving myself 20 mins to get a coffee and walk back to the station that was a 2 minute walk, would be more than enough. I will not be returning, poor service, rude staff."
"1677243219-243","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Ok, the staff was nice and the place looked clean.
However, when i opened the lid of my hot chocolate there was what appeared to be a long thick line of green mucus floating on the top!  2/5"
"1677243219-244","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Perth: served with a smile and kind words. Ran out of regular cups. Tea bag slung into a large cup with the milk and water. Never a fan of the f Starbucks coffee. It’s just nothing special."
"1677243219-245","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","I bought a venti caramel macchiato today, and while I was drinking it, something got stuck in my throat and I spat it out. A piece of cloth the size of a fingernail came out. I wish i could upload a picture. This store is located in Ellicott City, Maryland"
"1677243219-246","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Friendly staff as I visited Starbucks first time with my Children. This is at the Thurmaston Shopping Centre Leicester. We really enjoyed our experience at Starbucks. Thank you."
"1677243219-247","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","I recently visited a Starbucks and I'm very unhappy with my experience. The customer service was terrible. They were unhelpful and unresponsive. The coffee was also terrible. It was weak and tasteless."
"1677243219-248","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Starbucks is my least favorite coffee shop. It tastes watered down, the milk in their coffee drinks isn't frothed properly and the prices are way too high. Their food options aren't very good either - everything always taste reheated and not fresh at all. The customer service here can be quite slow as well; no one smiles or welcomes you when entering a store, making it difficult to even enjoy your experience there!"
"1677243219-249","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","I have been a loyal customer for years and have always had an amazing experience. The coffee is always delicious and the food is fresh and flavorful. The baristas are also very friendly and helpful. I love that they offer a rewards program so I can get discounts and free drinks. I highly recommend Starbucks and give it 5 stars!"
"1677243219-250","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Even though Starbucks is overpriced and at most times filled with transformers and circus rejects, the internet is fast and they don't mind if you sit and work for hours at a time. I have the app, it's much better than having to pay each time."
"1677243219-251","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","I went to Starbucks Coral Springs today and they gave me a venti strawberry açaí in a smaller cup but at the same price this inaceptable. Never again."
"1677243219-252","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","The rewards program is a joke. There is little incentive to get that extra cup of coffee. Offering 3 lattes for 25 stars. Basically spend $20 and you'll get 30 cents. No thanks. I'll save my money and drink one cup."
"1677243219-253","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Went to the Gloucester Starbucks tonight as they turned off the ordering by the app, got there and was told they weren’t doing frappacinos. Was told it was to late, we ordered at 8pm and they were open until 8.30pm, I can’t find information anywhere that state you have to order certain drinks by a certain time."
"1677243219-254","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","To be honest, I don't love Starbucks coffee, is not that good but is not bad either, but, finding a Starbucks is so easy, that's why is my ""to go"" coffee shop, because honestly I prefer to brew my own coffee (It's way more cheaper) but when I am feeling lazy or just don't have the time or energy, I rather grab a cup of coffee around any corner."
"1677243219-255","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Since I really love Starbucks, I would have to give this place a thumbs up for consistency, quality and cleanliness. The internet is also really fast. I love it!"
"1677243219-256","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","The wait is pretty long and depending on the location, some baristas get VERY overwhelmed..they mix up orders and some get pissy about giving you whipped cream on a latte when another person can get an entire cup of it for free if they say it's for a dog...... very fair.."
"1677243219-257","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Borehamwood branch. Lazy staff x3 ignoring me even though I was standing waiting at the register, cash in hand, trying to make eye contact. Not like I was browsing and they may have assumed I wasn’t ready to order. Seemed pissy when I mentioned I had been ignored. Isn’t it simple to just look and say you’ll be a minute or do you want some help. Very disappointing and rude."
"1677243219-258","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Bexleyheath branch
Ask for tea and given (and charged for) a huge mug. Tastes horrible’Teavana’ brand. Shouldn’t automatically give you large.
Husband had tuna panini and it was doughy…not griddled. Hardly any tuna in it either. 
Only good thing is their fruit toast!"
"1677243219-259","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.starbucks.com","","Visited a Starbucks. Drinks are way overpriced  and at close to $7, cost as much as a sandwich and drink elsewhere. Expect polite, accurate service, but usually receive rushed, messed up drink order, especially when customized.        Do they even have enough trained employees to cover the number of customers coming through??"
