"Used to love Starbucks. I've been a customer since the '80s, but have witnessed such a decline in the past 10 years & it's accelerating. Customer service, as a company, is plummeting. Prices have skyrocketed, outpacing inflation.

Their star rewards program has been changed to the point where you have to buy approximately 9,723 drinks at full price to get an alternative milk for no upcharge on drink number 9,724. And then you have to start collecting stars again from zero.  Collect enough to get a free drink? Not anymore--it will take you a cool half mil to buy enough coffee from them to earn a free drink. 

And don't get me started on their Little Debbie-style pastries. They're overpriced flavorless junk.

And Olive oil coffee? Wth? Excuse me--gotta be pretentious--""Oleato"". What happened to the sugar free or light flavors Starbucks used to have? Now their only option is sugar free vanilla. No light fraps. No light mocha. No light lattes. But you certainly CAN order a white chocolate, olive oil latte with vanilla sweet cream cold foam for a total of 3,000 calories ... Gross."
"I used to be a Starbucks fan in Indonesia. For some reason (well, probably a result of sleek marketing) the coffeeshops still have a good appeal; a mix of good locations, familiar look&feel, and nice staff I suppose. However the coffee quality is outright poor, and prices ridiculously high. I am shifting to some of the local brands, which put in a lot more effort to serve decent coffee, at a decent price."
"Starbucks is providing good services and staff is very professional.
They are provide quality products. I like Coffee. 
I am giving 4 stars because at some outlets they have very congested sitting space.
I recommend it."
I am a long time Starbucks fan but the service at the Campbell and Fulton location was awful. They were rude and didn?t even try and be nice and got my drinks wrong eventhough I told them what was needed and no apologies  or offer to remake drinks. They made no eye contact and seem to have no management skills. Won?t go there again.
"Starbucks is the worst fast food restaurant. (I would like to preface that I don?t eat fast food and so I don?t really know any fast foods. ) They pull you in with flashy advertising and promise of good taste just to pay 2 dollars for a coffee you could?ve made at home for less. Take their coffee, it is 2.10 cents for a plain, no nonsense drink. Compare that to a 1.69 cents large coffee from Mcdonalds, you get so much more bang for your buck and it doesn?t taste half bad. But we have to consider these arguments coming from a twelve year old who doesn?t. Yes, it is accessible and easy to find and when you are away from home it seems like the best option, but in reality you are just racking up the bills to eat something you have convinced yourself is tasty. Their food isn?t that bad. But you can really only say that when you haven?t eaten in a couple hours and you are running on a starbucks drink. Their customer base has sold their soul to the franchise so largely that they can convince themselves that frozen reheated eggs and wilted spinach tastes good. Now I don?t know everything and since most of the starbucks fanbase is a lost cause I can really only say this as an avid starbucks hater. Everyday I wake up surrounded by Starbucks lovers. I?ve witnessed the addiction first hand and if I am going to be honest, it is not pretty"
"Twice in the last two weeks, once in SanDiego and once in Elk River, MN, I ordered a latte. I sat for a good 10 minutes and finally asked what happened to my order. They point to an obscure area and there it sits, now lukewarm. Is this a new procedure? No one called my name,nothing. They just set it there and move onto the next order. I have sung Starbucks praises for years as being consistently great. One more shot and I?m done. It?s too expensive not to be great and at least hot and to have to wait 10 minutes. I?m very sad about my favorite coffee shop changing."
"We visited Cribbs Causeway recently and when we went to look for a place to buy a coffee, Starbucks told us that they didn't accept cash anymore. What an inconsiderate company.  Pleased to say that Costa Coffee in Cribbs Causeway does accept cash so we always go there now.   When we look for a coffee shop, both Costa Coffee and Cafe Nero accept cash payment so they have our custom - we no longer even consider Starbucks as it does not accept cash anymore."
"Starbucks in Seattle is the best Starbucks, just love it. Excellent service, good value and clean inside."
I called Starbucks customer service about getting the year in review email resent. They say it's not possible.  I find it hard to believe that a multi billion dollar company can't resend the email. Or make this available on the app or website.  That is ridiculous and unexceptable for a company that values their rewards members.
"They need to be more upfront about how sugary their drinks are. I looked up a Tazo Chai and its 42 grams of sugar! You'd think a Tazo Chai would be a healthier choice, but boy is that wrong."
"There is a wonderful sweet young girl that takes good care of me Krista she always welcomes me and takes great care of me.
She deserves the best employee rating!"
"I went into Starbucks this morning and ordered a Strawberry Acai drink, which was basically water and strawberry seeds which came to a shocking price of œ4.50, just for some water and seeds. I also found when I was ordering this drink that it was like a hassle for the staff member to make it. Overall I am incredibly disapointed."
"Fantastic customer service from Amy in the Ipswich Town Centre branch today, a real example of what customer service should be."
Fantastic customer service from Amy in the Ipswich Town Centre Starbucks today. Very polite and helpful.
"In Starbucks at Custer/15th in Plano with friends when the SB employee screamed at a group of several 5th grade girls to be quiet. Not appropriate at any time, but especially not at this moment because the kids weren?t being loud. Message received?this Starbucks doesn?t want children in their place of business."
"I have no idea why Starbucks has such bad reviews. Besides the bathrooms which are pretty bad at most locations, I love the service. the coffee is ok, but I really appreciate the internet."
"In the past the medium house blend was one of my favourites, this time I bought some at morrisons to make at home. Big mistake,  upon opening the bag I was greater with a fishy almost curry like smell. Thinking it was probably just packaging gas I proceeded to brew the coffee.  It tastes nothing like at the store, infact it tastes worse than lidl coffee.

I won't be buying this again, I do buy Costa signature medium, this actually tastes better than in their store."
"Starbucks is my least favorite coffee shop. It tastes watered down, the milk in their coffee drinks isn't frothed properly and the prices are way too high. Their food options aren't very good either - everything always taste reheated and not fresh at all. The customer service here can be quite slow as well; no one smiles or welcomes you when entering a store, making it difficult to even enjoy your experience there!"
"To begin, I believe that many individuals purchase Starbucks for the sake of the brand, rather than their coffee quality. In my view, it's more of a status symbol than a genuine appreciation for their coffee. However, I personally enjoy their coffee, particularly when blended, despite not being a fan of hot coffee. Although it is quite expensive, with a single cup costing up to $6, they can charge such exorbitant prices because consumers like myself continue to purchase from them. Their baked goods, such as the banana nut bread, may not be very appetizing, but I find them aesthetically pleasing. Ultimately, taste preferences vary, so it is up to each person's discretion. On a positive note, the staff at Starbucks are generally quite pleasant, which is definitely a plus."
Friendly staff as I visited Starbucks first time with my Children. This is at the Thurmaston Shopping Centre Leicester. We really enjoyed our experience at Starbucks. Thank you.
